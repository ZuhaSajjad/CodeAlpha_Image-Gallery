Project Title: Image Gallery

Description: The Image Gallery project is a visually appealing web application designed to display a collection of images in a grid layout. Users can interact with the gallery to view images in a larger modal view. The project features:

Grid Layout: The gallery uses a responsive grid system to arrange images in a flexible, clean layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
Image Modal: Clicking on any image opens a modal window displaying the image in a larger view. The modal is centered on the screen and provides a clean, focused view of the selected image.
Modal Controls: The modal includes a close button to dismiss the view and can also handle clicks outside the image to close the modal.
Styling: The design incorporates a light gradient background and uses a professional font to ensure a polished, elegant appearance.
Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the content of the gallery and modal.
CSS: For styling the gallery, modal, and overall layout.
JavaScript: For enabling interactive functionality such as opening the modal, displaying the selected image, and handling user interactions.
Features:

Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
Smooth transitions and user-friendly interface.
Basic image navigation within the modal.
This project is ideal for showcasing a collection of images in a modern, accessible way, suitable for portfolios, photo galleries, or any application requiring image display functionality.
